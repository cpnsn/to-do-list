# TODO

## Why did a choose to build a to-do list website?

- it was a good way for me to learn how to use all CRUD operations
- it offered a lot of possibilities

## Main mistake

not thinking of all the features I wanted to implement before starting

## Next steps

- make the tasks editable
- add a feature giving users the possibility to rearrange the lists
- add a note/post it feature
- Make it responsive!
